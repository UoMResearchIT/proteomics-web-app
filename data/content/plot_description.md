# Plot for data set exploration

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA plots are instrumental in pinpointing sources of variability among replicates within the data set. They can be used to explore each individual data set and visualise patterns related to conditions relevant to the biological context of the study. These conditions may include experimental groups, treatment effects, or diseases.

**Hierarchical Clustering Heatmap**: This plot provides a representation of the relationships between proteins in different samples, facilitating the identification of patterns and trends within the data. The plots can identify patterns of correlations among replicates within a data set.

**Single Protein Search**: Use bar plots and box plots to visually explore a protein of interest identified in a data set. These plots showcase the normalised, log-transformed abundance of the protein, highlighting variations related to factors such as treatment, disease, or experimental groups.
